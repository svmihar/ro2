    "A store produces and sells shirts and jackets. The price of a shirt is at 100 e, while the price of a jacket is at 90 Euro. Every shirt needs 2 $m^2$ of cotton and 5 $m^2$ of linen, while every jacket needs 4 $m^2$ of cotton and 3 $m^2$ of linen. The store can buy from its supplier 600 $m^2$ of cotton and 700 $m^2$ of linen every week. The company aims to achieve a weekly profit of 18,000 Euro. The production time of a pair of each product is 2 man-hours. The company employs 10 people in the production department and would like to keep within the 380 available hours of work each week. The manufacturing capacity of the machine for all products combined is limited to a maximum of 200 products per week. The company has signed a contract with a customer to provide his/her company with at least 60 units of each product per week."
